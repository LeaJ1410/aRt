This function will create some amazing artwork for you by entering any number close to your heart: 
your student ID, the birthday of your best friend, your zip code etc. 
After, just sit back, wait for your special artwork to be generated (hopefully your R won't crash like mine did),
and look at the most beautiful art you have ever laid your eyes on.   

You need to install the following packages for the function:
install.packages("ambient")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("scico")

Examples: 
make_art(5)

make_art(10)
